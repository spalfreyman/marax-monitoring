# Mara X Monitoring

Fork from tapayne88 to run on raspberry Pi Zero as its running an arm chip architecture

![Granfana Preview](./preview.png "Granfana Preview")

Take serial connection from Mara X containing temperature data a persist in a database and expose via grafana.

Docker will persist DB storage using volumes so restarts won't cause data loss.

Tested on a Raspberry Pi
